Space-Based Solar Power
 - Proposed at beginning of the space age.


Why Solar?
 - Limited fossil fuel?
 - No greenhouse gas emmitted
 - "Solar energy is plentiful, clean, and for all practical purposes provides a limitless source of power." - LLNL

Why Space Based? / Why not ground?
 - Not always sunny (clouds + night)
 - Low energy density on ground?
 - Remote bases and villages could get power without much ground x

Laser:
 - 1 MW of Power per satellite
 - Low Earth Ordbit
 - 3600 m2 or > half football field for collector, focused into 12m2
pro
 - 1000 fold reduced overall size requirements


Microwave:
pro
 - Good transmition in cloud cover
 - transmitted through air at intensity no greater than midday sun.

cons
 - Huge sie of microwave Rectenna on earth

Going Forward: 
 - launch/flight costs will go down (multiple launches to a single launch)
 - no need for human participation
 - 3D printers?
 - limited amount of oil in ground

Barriers:
 - billions $$ --- R&D, flight costs
 - Lasers in space is illegal
 - lasers through the air is dangerous (but only 2 meters in diameter)
 - microwave rectenna's are 2km in diameter
