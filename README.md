# Space-Based Solar Power

Find the article at [Energy.gov/articles/space-based-solar-power](http://energy.gov/articles/space-based-solar-power).

This page was written with the help of many, and uses the following libraries:

 * [Skrollr](https://github.com/Prinzhorn/skrollr)
 * [jquery-animate-css-rotate-scale](https://github.com/zachstronaut/jquery-animate-css-rotate-scale)

It uses Jquery, which I know is unfashionable but who cares, right? It works (mostly :) and that's what matters.

It _should_ work in all modern browsers and degrade gracefully (enough) in IE8. It should also be mobile responsive. If you see a bug, please let me know!
